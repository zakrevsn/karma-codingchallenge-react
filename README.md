# Coding Challenge Web Frontend (React.js)

Dear hiring developer,

you can proudly claim you reached level 2 in the hiring process of becoming a 
**Karma** developer. That being said, we would like to see some convincing code in order to
evaluate your programming skills. Nothing too fancy, don't invest more time than you are willing to.

The evaluation of the submitted result will be based on the following criteria:
* how are your commits organized (don't use one bulk commit at the end of the development, use meaningful commit 
messages for your growing codebase)
* how are you managing to work with `npm` and third-party packages
* how are your components and your code structured (HOC vs dump components, folder/file structure, etc.)
* how much are you committed to clean code and good-practice patterns

If you cannot relate to one or all of the above mentioned points don't be afraid. The coding challenge is 
addressed to all developing levels from junior to senior level! We will evaluate whatever you deliver.
